# Cancelled Subscription Booking Prevention

## Problem
Users with cancelled subscriptions could still book lessons. The system wasn't properly clearing user data when cancelling subscriptions and wasn't validating cancelled status during booking.

## Issues Identified
1. ❌ When cancelling subscription, `remainingClasses` and `lessonCredits` were not cleared
2. ❌ Package information (`packageId`, `packageName`, `membershipType`) remained
3. ❌ Booking validation didn't check for 'cancelled' status
4. ❌ Users with 0 credits but active status could still attempt bookings

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cancellation Process (`memberService.js`)

When a subscription is cancelled, the system now:
- ✅ Sets status to 'cancelled'
- ✅ Clears `remainingClasses` to 0
- ✅ Clears `lessonCredits` to 0
- ✅ Removes package information (`packageId`, `packageName`, `membershipType`)
- ✅ Preserves original data in `originalMembershipData` for audit/refund purposes

```javascript
const cancelData = {
  membershipStatus: 'cancelled',
  status: 'cancelled',
  cancellationDate: new Date().toISOString(),
  cancellationReason: reason,
  refundAmount: refundAmount || 0,
  cancelledBy: cancelledBy || 'admin',
  // Clear remaining classes and credits
  remainingClasses: 0,
  lessonCredits: 0,
  // Clear package information
  packageId: null,
  packageName: null,
  membershipType: null,
  // Keep original data for audit purposes
  originalMembershipData: {
    membershipType: memberData.membershipType || null,
    remainingClasses: memberData.remainingClasses || 0,
    lessonCredits: memberData.lessonCredits || 0,
    packageId: memberData.packageId || null,
    packageName: memberData.packageName || null,
    membershipStatus: memberData.membershipStatus
  },
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp()
};
```

### 2. Updated Booking Validation (`lessonService.js`)

Added 'cancelled' status check as the FIRST validation (before frozen/inactive):

```javascript
// Check if membership is cancelled
if (userData.membershipStatus === 'cancelled' || userData.status === 'cancelled') {
  return {
    success: false,
    messageKey: 'classes.membershipCancelled'
  };
}
```

### 3. Translation Support

#### Turkish (`tr.js`)
```javascript
membershipCancelled: 'Üyeliğiniz iptal edilmiş. Ders rezervasyonu yapamazsınız. Yeni üyelik için lütfen yönetici ile iletişime geçin.'
```

#### English (`en.js`)
```javascript
membershipCancelled: 'Your membership has been cancelled. You cannot book lessons. Please contact the administrator for a new membership.'
```

## Validation Order (Priority)

The booking system now validates in this order:
1. 🚫 **Cancelled Status** - Immediate rejection with renewal guidance
2. ❄️ **Frozen Status** - Temporary suspension
3. ⏸️ **Inactive Status** - Need to renew/activate
4. 💳 **Credit Availability** - Must have remaining lessons
5. 📅 **Lesson Existence** - Valid lesson ID
6. 👥 **Lesson Capacity** - Not fully booked
7. ✅ **Duplicate Check** - User not already registered

## Data State After Cancellation

### Before Cancellation
```javascript
{
  membershipStatus: 'active',
  status: 'active',
  remainingClasses: 5,
  lessonCredits: 5,
  packageId: 'pkg_8_lesson',
  packageName: '8 Ders Paketi',
  membershipType: '8-lessons'
}
```

### After Cancellation
```javascript
{
  membershipStatus: 'cancelled',
  status: 'cancelled',
  remainingClasses: 0,              // ✅ CLEARED
  lessonCredits: 0,                 // ✅ CLEARED
  packageId: null,                  // ✅ CLEARED
  packageName: null,                // ✅ CLEARED
  membershipType: null,             // ✅ CLEARED
  cancellationDate: '2025-01-09T...',
  cancellationReason: 'User request',
  refundAmount: 150,
  cancelledBy: 'admin_uid',
  originalMembershipData: {         // ✅ PRESERVED FOR AUDIT
    membershipType: '8-lessons',
    remainingClasses: 5,
    lessonCredits: 5,
    packageId: 'pkg_8_lesson',
    packageName: '8 Ders Paketi',
    membershipStatus: 'active'
  }
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Security & Business Logic**
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized lesson bookings
- ✅ Ensures cancelled users cannot consume services
- ✅ Protects studio from revenue loss

### 2. **Data Integrity**
- ✅ Clear separation between active and cancelled users
- ✅ No orphaned credits after cancellation
- ✅ Package information properly cleared

### 3. **Audit Trail**
- ✅ Original membership data preserved in `originalMembershipData`
- ✅ Can calculate accurate refunds based on remaining lessons
- ✅ Historical tracking of cancellation reasons

### 4. **User Experience**
- ✅ Clear error messages explaining why booking failed
- ✅ Multi-language support (Turkish/English)
- ✅ Guidance to contact admin for new membership

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Cancel Active Subscription
**Setup:**
- User has active membership with 5 remaining lessons
- Admin cancels subscription with refund

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Status changes to 'cancelled'
- ✅ `remainingClasses` → 0
- ✅ `lessonCredits` → 0
- ✅ Package info cleared
- ✅ Original data saved in `originalMembershipData`

### Test 2: Cancelled User Attempts to Book
**Setup:**
- User with cancelled subscription tries to book a lesson

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Booking blocked immediately
- ✅ Error message: "Your membership has been cancelled..."
- ✅ No credit check performed (cancelled check comes first)

### Test 3: Refund Calculation
**Setup:**
- User had 5 lessons remaining when cancelled
- Need to calculate refund amount

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Can access `originalMembershipData.remainingClasses` (5)
- ✅ Can calculate: (5 lessons × price per lesson) = refund
- ✅ Historical data preserved for accounting

### Test 4: Multiple Status Checks
**Setup:**
- Test various status combinations

**Expected Results:**
| Status | Can Book? | Error Message |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| cancelled | ❌ | Membership cancelled |
| frozen | ❌ | Membership frozen |
| inactive | ❌ | Membership inactive |
| active + 0 credits | ❌ | Insufficient credits |
| active + credits | ✅ | Success |

## Files Modified

### Admin Panel (zenithstudio)
- `/src/services/memberService.js` - Enhanced `cancelMembership()` function

### Mobile App (zenithapp)
- `/src/services/lessonService.js` - Added cancelled status validation
- `/src/locales/tr.js` - Added Turkish translation
- `/src/locales/en.js` - Added English translation

## Backward Compatibility

The solution maintains backward compatibility:
- ✅ Checks both `membershipStatus` and `status` fields
- ✅ Checks both `remainingClasses` and `lessonCredits` fields
- ✅ Gracefully handles null/undefined values
- ✅ Preserves existing data in audit object

## Admin Panel Impact

When viewing cancelled members:
- 📊 Can see cancellation date and reason
- 💰 Can see refund amount
- 📝 Can access original membership details
- 🔍 Can track who cancelled (admin UID)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Reactivation Flow**: Allow admins to reactivate cancelled memberships
2. **Partial Refunds**: Calculate refunds based on unused lessons automatically
3. **Cancellation Reports**: Analytics on cancellation reasons
4. **Grace Period**: Allow X days after cancellation to reverse decision
5. **Credit Transfer**: Option to transfer unused credits to another user
