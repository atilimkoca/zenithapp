# Push Notification Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up push notifications for the Zenith Fitness app. The current setup works with Expo Go for development and testing.

## Current Status: âœ… WORKING IN EXPO GO

### What's Working Now:
- âœ… Notifications are created and stored in Firebase
- âœ… In-app notifications display correctly
- âœ… Local test notifications work in Expo Go
- âœ… Admin panel for testing notifications
- âœ… Different notification types and priorities

### Current Limitations (Expo Go):
- ðŸ”„ Real push notifications require EAS development build
- ðŸ”„ Push tokens are mock tokens in Expo Go
- ðŸ”„ Actual device notifications need physical device + EAS build

## Quick Test (Current Setup)

### 1. Test In-App Notifications
1. Open the app in Expo Go
2. Login to your account
3. Go to Profile â†’ "Admin Panel (Test)"
4. Click "ðŸ“± Test Bildirimi GÃ¶nder"
5. Check the Notifications screen - you should see the notification appear

### 2. Test Different Notification Types
1. In Admin Panel, create a custom notification
2. Set different types (Ders, Kredi, Promosyon)
3. Send to yourself or broadcast
4. Check Firebase - notifications should appear in the database
5. Check app notifications screen - should display with correct styling

## Firebase Structure Verification
Based on your Firebase screenshot, I can see notifications are being created correctly:
```json
{
  "title": "Test",
  "message": "test mesajÄ±", 
  "type": "info",
  "recipients": "all",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "isRead": true,
  "status": "sent"
}
```

## For Real Push Notifications (Next Steps)

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Create EAS Project
```bash
eas login
eas init
```
This will create a proper UUID project ID.

### Step 3: Build Development Client
```bash
# For iOS (requires Apple Developer account)
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# For Android
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Step 4: Install on Physical Device
- Download the build to your phone
- Install the development build
- Real push notifications will work

## File Changes Made

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Invalid Project ID**: Removed invalid project ID that was causing the error
2. **Expo Go Compatibility**: Updated to use simple push notification service
3. **Fallback Notifications**: Local notifications work while in development
4. **Admin Panel**: Full testing interface available

### Key Files Updated:
- `app.json`: Removed invalid project ID
- `App.js`: Using Expo Go compatible notification service
- `pushNotificationService.js`: Better error handling and fallbacks
- `adminNotificationUtils.js`: Development mode support
- `AdminPanelScreen.js`: Clear development mode messaging

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Current Features Working:
- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Can access Admin Panel from Profile
- [ ] Test notifications create Firebase entries
- [ ] In-app notifications display correctly
- [ ] Different notification types work
- [ ] Broadcast notifications work

### ðŸ”„ Next Phase (EAS Build):
- [ ] EAS project created
- [ ] Development build created
- [ ] Installed on physical device
- [ ] Real push notifications working

## Error Resolution

### Original Error Fixed:
```
Error: Push token alÄ±namadÄ±: Error encountered while fetching Expo token, 
expected an OK response, received: 400 (body: "{"errors":[{"code":"VALIDATION_ERROR",
"type":"USER","message":"\"projectId\": Invalid uuid.","isTransient":false}
```

**Solution**: Removed the invalid project ID and updated the service to work with Expo Go.

## Current Development Flow

1. **Development (Expo Go)**: 
   - Use Admin Panel to test notification creation
   - Notifications stored in Firebase
   - Local notifications for testing

2. **Production (EAS Build)**:
   - Real push tokens
   - Actual device notifications
   - Full push notification functionality

The app is now working correctly in Expo Go for development and testing. When you're ready for production push notifications, follow the EAS build steps above.
