# Expo Go Push Notifications - Important Information

## Overview
Starting with Expo SDK 53, Android push notifications (remote notifications) are **NOT supported in Expo Go** during development. This is a development limitation only and does not affect production builds.

## Current Status
- **SDK Version**: 54.0.7
- **Error in Expo Go**: "Android Push notifications functionality was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53"
- **Impact**: Development/testing only
- **Production**: ✅ Push notifications work normally

## What This Means

### ❌ Does NOT work:
- Testing push notifications in Expo Go on Android devices during development

### ✅ DOES work:
- Push notifications in production APK/AAB builds
- Push notifications when app is published to Google Play Store
- Push notifications in Expo Go on iOS devices
- All other app features in Expo Go on Android

## Testing Push Notifications

### Option 1: Test on iOS (Easiest)
- Use Expo Go on iPhone/iPad
- Push notifications work normally on iOS

### Option 2: Build Preview/Production APK
```bash
# Build a preview build to test
eas build --profile preview --platform android

# Or build production
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

### Option 3: Development Build (Advanced)
If you need to test push notifications frequently on Android:
```bash
# Install expo-dev-client (already installed)
npx expo install expo-dev-client

# Build development build
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the APK on your device and run
npx expo start --dev-client
```

## Recommendation for Development

### Continue with Expo Go for:
- UI development
- Feature implementation
- General testing
- Quick iterations

### Use Production Builds for:
- Push notification testing
- Final QA before release
- Store submission

## No Action Required
✅ Your app is configured correctly
✅ Push notifications will work in production
✅ This is expected behavior with Expo SDK 54+
✅ No code changes needed
